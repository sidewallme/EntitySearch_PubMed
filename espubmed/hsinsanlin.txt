 Relationship between thrombin generation and carotid intima-media thickness. Increasing evidence indicates that thrombin plays a role not only in thrombosis but also in the progression of atherosclerosis. The relationship between thrombin generation and intima-media thickness (IMT) as an index of subclinical atherosclerosis was investigated. Participants, material, methods: We examined 163 asymptomatic middle-aged persons free of overt clinical atherosclerotic disease. They underwent ultrasonography of the common carotid arteries. In addition, thrombin generation was measured by means of CAT (calibrated automated thrombography). For our study we divided the healthy study participants into three age groups (&lt;45, 45-60 and &gt;60 years). A significant positive correlation was seen between endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) (p = 0.012), time to peak (TTP) (p = 0.033) start tail (p = 0.007) and carotid IMT in the group of healthy volunteers younger than 45 years. We demonstrated that in adults younger than 45 years without clinically overt atherosclerotic disease ETP was significantly associated with carotid IMT. It is tempting to speculate that ETP may serve as an index for subclinical atherosclerosis in persons below 45 years.

 Quality control of fifteen probiotic products containing Saccharomyces boulardii. The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii is used as a probiotic for the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea. In this study, the quality of 15 probiotic products containing S. boulardii was verified. Using microsatellite typing, the identity of all Saccharomyces strains in the products was confirmed as S. boulardii. Additionally, solid-phase cytometry (SPC) and a plate method were used to enumerate S. boulardii cells. SPC was not only able to produce results more rapidly than plating (4h compared to 48h) but the cell counts obtained with SPC were significantly higher than the plate counts. Finally, we found that &lt;1% of the S. boulardii cells survived 120min in gastric conditions and storage for 3months at 40°C with 75% relative humidity. We developed a SPC method for the quantification of viable S. boulardii cells in probiotics. Additionally, we demonstrated that gastric conditions and storage have a marked effect on the viability of the yeast cells.   To our knowledge, this is the first time SPC is used for the quality control of probiotics with S. boulardii. Additionally, we demonstrated the need for gastric protection and accurate storage.

 Economic evaluation of sorafenib in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. A double-blind, randomized phase III trial of sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrated that sorafenib significantly prolonged overall survival compared to placebo (median overall survival = 10.7 months vs 7.9 months, P &lt; 0.001). Sorafenib is the first and only systemic agent demonstrating survival benefit in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib versus best supportive care in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA. A Markov model was developed following time-to-progression and survival using phase III trial data. Health effects are expressed as life-years gained. Resource utilization included drugs, physician visits, laboratory tests, scans, and hospitalizations. Unit costs, expressed in 2007 $US, came from diagnosis-related groupings, fee schedules, and the Red Book. Costs and effects were evaluated over a patient's lifetime and discounted at 3%. Results are presented as incremental cost/life-year gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Life-years gained were increased for sorafenib compared to best supportive care (mean ± standard deviation: 1.58 ± 0.17 vs 1.05 ± 0.10 life-years gained/sorafenib patient and best supportive care, respectively). Lifetime total costs were $US40,639 ± $US3052 for sorafenib and $US7, 804 ± $US1349 for best supportive care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $US62,473/life-year gained.   The economic evaluation indicates that sorafenib is cost-effective compared to best supportive care, with a cost-effectiveness ratio within the established threshold that US society is willing to pay (i.e. $US50,000-$US100,000) and significantly lower than alternative thresholds suggested in recent years ($US183,000-$US264,000/life-year gained, or $US300,000/quality-adjusted life-year) in oncology.

 Role of ABCG8 D19H (rs11887534) variant in gallstone susceptibility in northern India. The excretion of cholesterol from the liver is regulated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG8. A common genetic polymorphism D19H of ABCG8 might be related to the genetic predisposition of gallstone disease, which is causatively related to supersaturation of cholesterol in bile. We aimed to examine the role of the ABCG8 D19H (rs11887534) polymorphism in susceptibility to gallstone disease in the northern Indian population. The study included 220 confirmed gallstone patients and 230 controls. Genotyping for the ABCG8 D19H polymorphism was carried out using the PCR-RFLP method. We observed that the ABCG8 DH genotype frequency was significantly higher in gallstone patients (P = 0.038; odds ratio [OR] = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-4.6). At allele level also, the ABCG8 variant allele conferred an increased risk for gallstone susceptibility (P = 0.043; OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.2-4.3). The risk as a result of ABCG8 D19H variation was more pronounced in female gallstone patients at genotype (P = 0.026; OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.1-7.9) as well as allele level (P = 0.030; OR = 2.85; 95% CI = 1.1-7.3). However, the molecular modeling results of the rs11887534 polymorphism showed that the overall configuration of both wild-type and polymorphic ABCG8 protein were similar, with negligible deviation at the site of polymorphism.   Carriers of the DH genotype and H allele of the ABCG8 D19H polymorphism harbor a higher risk for gallstone susceptibility in the northern Indian population.

 Fit of zirconia fixed partial denture: a systematic review. The aim of this study is to review all the published literature investigating the accuracy of fit of zirconia fixed partial dentures (FPD). A comprehensive electronic search was performed through PubMed (MEDLINE) using Boolean operators to combine the following key words: 'zirconia,''margin,''FPD,''internal,''fit,''gap,''fitting surface,''bridge' and 'fixed prosthesis.' The search was limited to articles written in English, published up to January 2010. In addition, a manual search was also conducted through articles and reference lists retrieved from the electronic search and peer-reviewed journals. A total of 115 articles were retrieved and only 15 met the specified inclusion criteria for the review. Twelve of these articles were in vitro and three of them were in vivo. The selected articles had assessed marginal and/or internal fit of zirconia FPDs against the effect of various parameters that were computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and CAM systems, post-sintered and pre-sintered milling, framework configuration, span length, veneer application and ageing. CAD/CAM, post-sintered milling, straight configuration and shorter span frameworks provided superior results than CAM, pre-sintered milling, curved configuration and longer span frameworks. Veneering zirconia frameworks caused deterioration in fit, while ageing of zirconia had no implications on the fit. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of the differences in the accuracy reported in this review.
